      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        COMIT stands for "Competitive IT Events" a Web service-oriented application which provides
		means to explore, filter, visualize, and update information regarding the participants to
		various IT competitive events (e.g., programming or algorithm-related competitions,
		Web challenges, hackathons, etc.) and their submitted solutions.
		<p>Furthermore, the system provides useful recommendations
		about alternative solutions, additional tips & tricks, similar problems and events, tutorials, on-line
		courses, public code repositories, interesting persons (mentors, winners, organizing entities, sponsors,
		and others).</p>
		<p>The web application is built with Java on the server-side, using Spring Boot as a framework
		and PostgreSql with pgAdmin4; as for the client-side, the application is build with Angular 8. Moreover,
		the application is built upon MVC architecture.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In this Scholarly HTML technical report we will try to cover the preliminary considerations
		about the Web application design and interaction, the provenece of external data resources and
		the applied technologies and pattern applied in the development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will start with an application overview, by explaning the main functionalities available
		to the final users, as well as which are the main functionalities that will be provided to the end user.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step would be provide basic information about the used technologies and the implied
		programming languages, as well as some informations about the used database technologies.
      </p>
	  <p>
		To round up we will provide the developers considerations and the limitations encountered throughout
		the development process. As a reminder the ongoing development of the application can be followed at
		<a href="https://github.com/Solonaru/COMIT">our github repository</a>. Feel free to provide suggestions
		or suggest improvements.

      <!-- review? -->
	  <h2>Development methodology</h2>
	  <p>
		Waterfall methodology is a linear project management approach, where stakeholder and customer requirements
		are gathered at the beginning of the project, and then a sequential project plan is created to accommodate
		those requirements.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The 5 phases used in the develompent process of this project are:
	  </p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Requirements</b>: The key aspect of waterfall is that all customer requirements are gathered at
			the beginning of the project, allowing every other phase to be planned without further customer
			involvement until the product is complete. It is assumed that all requirements can be gathered 
			at this phase.</li>
			<li><b>Design</b>: The design phase is best broken up into logical design and physical design subphases.
			The logical design subphase is when possible solutions are brainstormed and theorized. The physical
			design subphase is when those theoretical ideas and schemas are made into concrete specifications.</li>
			<li><b>Implementation</b>: The implementation phase is when programmers assimilate the requirements and
			specifications from the previous phases and produce actual code.</li>
			<li><b>Verification</b>:  This phase is when the customer reviews the product to make sure that it meets
			the requirements laid out at the beginning of the project. This is done by releasing a completed
			product to the customer.</li>
			<li><b>Maintenance</b>:  The customer is regularly using the product during the maintenance phase,
			discovering bugs, inadequate features and other errors that occurred during production. The
			production team applies these fixes as necessary until the customer is satisfied.</li>
		</ol>

      <h2>Main functionalities</h2>
      <p>
        The main functionalities and feautures of the COMIT Web Application are split on:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#guest_func">Guest functionalities</a> - mainly login and register;</li>
			<li><a href="#user_func">User functionalities</a> - how the standard will interact with the application and what functionalities
				are available to such users;</li>
			<li><a href="#admin_func">Admin functionalities</a> - mainly the functionalities which regard the administration and maintance
				of the application.</li>
		</ul>
      </p>
	  <section id="guest_func">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>Guest functionalities</h3>
        <p>
          The main functionalities available to guest users are:
			<ul>
				<li>A guest would be able to create a new account through the "Sign Up" page;</li>
				<li>A guest would be able to login through the "Login" page;</li>
				<li>A guest can visualize all the available events and challenges, but can't provide solutions to challenges.</li>
			</ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The functionalities provided to the guest user are quite limited, as other interactions require informations about the user.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="user_func">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>User functionalities</h3>
        <p>
          The main functionalities available to standard users are:
        </p>
        <ul>
			<li>A standard user can visualize all the available events;</li>
			<li>A standard user can visualize all the events available challenges;</li>
			<li>A standard user can filter events by:
				<ul>
					<li>Event type;</li>
					<li>Technology;</li>
					<li>Knowledge level;</li>
					<li>Status.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>A standard user can provide solutions to active challenges;</li>
			<li>A standard user can visualize the alternative provided solutions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
          Standard user have a wider range of functionalities compared to guest users.

        <p>
          The admin has mainly the administrative functionalities required to mantain the application
		  and ensure its normal flow as well as provide new content. The available functionalities are:
			<ul>
				<li>Add new events;</li>
				<li>Add challenges to events;</li>
				<li>Provide alternative solutions to challenges.</p>

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
	  <section id="angular_cli">
        <!-- review? -->
        <h3>Angular CLI</h3>
        <p>
          Angular Command Line Interface can be installed through npm. Angular CLI
		  is required to generate new angular project, angular components, service
		  and so on. Download and install Node from their official website and run
		  the below npm command to install angular CLI.
        </p>
        <p>
          To publish and install packages to and from the public npm registry or your
		  companyâ€™s npm Enterprise registry, you must install Node.js and the npm
		  command line interface using either a Node version manager or a Node
		  installer. We strongly recommend using a Node version manager to install
		  Node.js and npm. We do not recommend using a Node installer, since the
		  Node installation process installs npm in a directory with local
		  permissions and can cause permissions errors when you run npm packages
		  globally.		  
        </p>
		<figure typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode" resource="#npm-install" id="npm-install">
          <pre><code>
			npm install npm -g
          </code></pre>
        </figure>		
		<p>
		  To see if you already have Node.js and npm installed and check the installed
		  version, run the following commands:
		</p>
		<figure typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode" resource="#node-npm" id="node-npm">
          <pre><code>
			node -v
			npm -v
          </code></pre>
        </figure>
		<p>
		  Now install Angular CLI:
		</p>
		<figure typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode" resource="#install-angular-cli" id="install-angular-cli">
          <pre><code>
			npm install -g @angular/cli
          </code></pre>
